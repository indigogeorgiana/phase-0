What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?

On the whole I have learnt ALOT, and I often surprise myself at how much of that
phase zero information I have managed to retain. I also found that when I struggled but what I am certain I did well this phase was utlized Mindful meditation, and learned how to manage my stress an anxiety.

What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
Being that it was a learning experience I found areas that I could work on. Self confidence, being
okay with not being perfect at everything. I felt I needed alot more help with Sprint 7 and 8 as I did
experience some struggles.


What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in Bootcamp?
Learn how to manage stress
Build strong team mate bonds
Listen and take in as much information as I can
Ask for help without fear of judgement
Intergrate well within a team in environment
Constant communication
